An emphasis will be on the interactions between the vectors and disease-causing pathogens. Topics include: introductions to systematics, anatomy, physiology, life cycles, and ecology of vectors and classification and biology of the pathogens responsible for such diseases as dengue, yellow fever, malaria, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, etc. The focus will be not only on specific pathogen-vector interactions but also on big picture topics / discussions of vector competence, insecticide resistance, vector control (including genetically modified insects) and other current issues in vector biology research. Students will learn how these important vector-borne diseases are transmitted, how they are spread and introduced into new regions, and what control strategies exist or are currently under development. Students will realize what impact vector-borne diseases have on global human and animal health as well as develop and hone critical thinking skills.",
