We will provide an introduction to essential disciplines and interactions that enable scientific discoveries to move forward into novel device and drug therapies. Participants will come away with a very complete picture of how medical research happens, including: how it is funded; what is required to make discoveries and record and protect intellectual property that is created; how to advance innovations to clinical practice, how to navigate the regulatory and bioethical environment, and how discoveries reach practitioners and benefit patients.
