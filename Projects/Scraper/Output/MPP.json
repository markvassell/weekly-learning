The HSP/BIMO initiative comprehends all FDA regulated clinical trials including human drugs and biological drug products, devices, foods, and veterinary medicine. The course is designed for students in medical professions, management, biomedical engineering, and related areas. Adequate knowledge regarding FDA guidance in conducting human clinical trials and clinical research will help professionals steer drug/device development and commercialization in their respective field. This course will be offered online only. An introduction to essential disciplines for conducting clinical trials and clinical research will be provided. The basics of good clinical practices (GCPs), biostatistics and clinical epidemiology in relation to clinical trials will be presented. Several relevant case studies for conducting clinical trials, both nationally and internationally, will be discussed.

The course will explore a variety of receptor issues, primarily in a discussion format organized by the faculty members involved in the course. The course is divided into two related components. The first component will cover general principles of quantifying ligand - receptor interactions and subsequent responses, summarize some of the methods of receptor identification and characterization and evaluate the various schemes of receptor typing and subtyping. The second component will explore specific characteristics of receptors from some of the major receptor families with an emphasis on understanding mechanisms of receptor activation and regulation as well as exploring concepts about the structural basis for discrete receptor functions. A typical list of receptors to be covered in the course may include the tyrosine kinase recptors, G protein-coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, ligand activated transcription factors (nuclear receptors), adhesion receptors such as integrins, and ligand activated ion channels.",
