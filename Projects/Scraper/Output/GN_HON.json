Are we inherently selfish or social? Do we have a unitary \"self\" or are we made up of many (and sometimes contradictory) selves? Is there a single \"human\" nature or are there distinct \"male\" and \"female\" natures? Does human nature vary across cultures? Insights come from fields ranging from genetics to literature. The concept of \"human nature\" is fiercely contested and debated both within and between academic disciplines. We will be focusing on the scientific study of human nature, seeking naturalistic explanations by formulating and testing hypotheses. In particular, we will use evolutionary theory to unify explanations from disparate disciplines like biology, psychology, and anthropology. In each class, we will discuss one specific topic like sex or violence and seek to make sense of it from both the proximate level (what triggers the behavior and how does it develop?) and the ultimate level (why and how did our evolutionary history imbue us with this capacity?).

Course topics vary by semester but will bridge the social and behavioral sciences to address an overarching question: What makes us human? We will explore the social and behavioral factors that shape our shared human condition as well as those that contribute to diversity in the human experience. We will then investigate the complexities of what it means to be human within the globally interconnected societies we live in today. How do we deal creatively with human diversity in addressing the global problems and uncertainties that confront us? What attitudes, practices, and projects might help us manage global uncertainties and opportunities more effectively? What is your role in the global community of the twenty-first century? In exploring these questions through intensive reading, writing, research, and discussion, this course will help you develop a global consciousness that is sensitive to the lived textures and realities of places and peoples around the world. This course satisfies three credit hours of general education requirements in the behavioral and social sciences and is part of the Honors College's Interdisciplinary Topics in the Human Sciences series.
