TJC promotes the continuous improvement of health care by evaluating organizations and \"inspiring them to excel in providing safe and effective care of the highest quality and value.\" Failure of a health system to meet TJC requirements can result in loss of an organization's ability to participate in Medicare/Medicaid programs, which has a crippling effect on delivering patient care. Tracers are the tool TJC utilizes to evaluate the quality of patient care in an organization.
