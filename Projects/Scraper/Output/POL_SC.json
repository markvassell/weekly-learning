We will focus on scientific explanations of the rise of the human rights movement, political and economic explanations for human rights conditions, and the effects of advocacy efforts concerning human rights. After this class, you will have not only an understanding of the major players and factors influencing human rights, but a base understanding of the social scientific processes which govern human rights conditions and improvements. As such, this class is not a history class or a class on current events. Though current and historical events will be discussed, your grade will not depend on your rote memorization of these events. Instead, the focus will be on understanding the underlying interests of important actors towards human rights, the arenas in which these actors interact, and the rules which govern their interactions. This focus on the basic principles will provide you with a rich practical knowledge of human rights. At the conclusion of the course, you will be able to actively engage with the global human rights community.",

These events and developments will be examined in light of major theories in and methodological approaches adopted by the subfields of comparative politics and international relations, with the goal of exploring the strengths and weaknesses of alternative perspectives. At the end of the course, students should be familiar with the key debates and questions in the study of Chinese politics and foreign policy, and have a better sense of how to research questions on these topics. The course is also intended to encourage a dialogue between the study of China and the broader fields of comparative politics and international relations. Thus by the end of the course, students should have a sense not only for how the study of Chinese politics and foreign policy applies broader CP/IR theories to explain key patterns and events in China, but also gain insight into the question of what China as a case (or cases) can contribute back to major theories and debates in these fields.",
