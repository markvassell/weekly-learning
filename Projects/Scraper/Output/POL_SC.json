As such, this class is not a history class or a class on current events. Though current and historical events will be discussed, your grade will not depend on your rote memorization of these events. Instead, the focus will be on understanding the underlying interests of important actors towards human rights, the arenas in which these actors interact, and the rules which govern their interactions. This focus on the basic principles will provide you with a rich practical knowledge of human rights. At the conclusion of the course, you will be able to actively engage with the global human rights community.",

Although democracy has been on the rise in the last decades we have also seen new challenges emerge. Many countries have adopted democratic facades hiding the persistent stability of authoritarianism. We have also seen the rise of China and Russia in world politics, creating a powerful counterweight to the previously dominant liberal order.
