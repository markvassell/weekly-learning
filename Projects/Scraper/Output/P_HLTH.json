While bio-safety, epidemiology, & laboratory medicine are disciplines that are closely interrelated, they are not always optimally connected on functional & organizational levels. This course will provide an overview of the field of biological safety (shorthanded to 'bio-safety') & its application to epidemiology & laboratory medicine for the control biological hazards for students at all levels who are interested in the epidemiology of microbial diseases. Students will review biological hazards associated with occupational laboratory acquired infections, & examine select case studies to identify critical bio-safety lapses & outbreak scenarios of food borne illness using epidemiological tools. The course will teach participants how to perform a comprehensive qualitative risk assessment for the use bio-hazards in the laboratory & learn how to employ the control strategies to appropriately manage these risks for field epidemiology. This course will also convey the laboratory perspective of public health investigations to field epidemiologists in order to improve collaboration between these disciplines & to enhance the quality of field investigations as well as day-to-day interaction. Course concepts can be applied to the control of bio-hazards during the review of proposed research involving bio-hazards, along with emphasizing protective measures when addressing incidents involving bio-hazards, such as emergency spills or bio-terrorism related events.
