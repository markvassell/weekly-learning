Planters, combines, fertilizer application equipment and sprayer application equipment are commonly equipped with GPS equipment to control and record operational parameters. These parameters focus around the equipments geographic location and can be recorded simultaneously with the volume of product applied and weather information (wind, temperature, humidity, etc.). GPS guidance is one of the main technologies to be studied throughout this course. The management of this equipment and the GPS technologies used to control and record this information is the focus of the course.",
