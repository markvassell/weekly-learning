A list of pre-approved sites is available in the course office.  All of the sites available for the offsite experience have been carefully selected by the faculty based on previous experiences of fourth-year students.  These sites offer an appropriate level of patient care responsibility with supervision.  Offsite practices need to be approved in advance by the course director and often require planning 6 to 12 months in advance.  Students considering offsite rotations will be expected to have a clear idea of how these experiences will offer unique advantages to their personal and professional development, and how they will meet the course criteria. Many offsite locations used in the past for the Family Medicine Clerkship will not satisfy the externship requirement. They still offer excellent experiences and could be taken as electives.  Students on the offsite track will be evaluated with respect to their ability to collect, process, and analyze information, engage in clinical reasoning, and formulate appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans.
