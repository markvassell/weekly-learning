            "description": "Students will learn the behavioral principles and techniques currently employed to help children with autism acquire functional language, appropriate social behavior, and general academic and living skills as well as decrease problematic behaviors. The objectives of this course are to: 1) To identify and describe key features of applied behavior analysis (ABA), particularly as it applies to intervention for children with autism. 2) To identify and describe key issues in curricular design, program development, and evidence-based interventions in autism. 3) To become familiar with key outcome research in behavioral interventions for children with autism. 4) To become familiar with key research on language, social skills, self-help skills, and problem behavior reduction as these areas relate to the behavioral treatment of autism.

            "description": "This course will provide an overview of both classic and contemporary theory and research on nonhuman and human learning. We will focus on a behavior-analytic conceptualization of learning and the underlying research on basic processes and operations that result in learning. The readings and class discussions will provide you with a strong foundation in the psychology of learning from a behavioral orientation, with particular emphasis on the relation between biological and environmental contributions to selection of behavior. To effectively produce socially significant behavior change among members of clinical populations, we must approach the task with a thorough understanding of these basic principles.
