Understand the anesthetic state (e.g. the inability of a person to protect themselves from the environment; concomitant and common depression of other systems of the body other than the nervous system).  2. Learn how to think and react quickly and correctly in times of stress.  3. Develop knowledge and skill at maintaining artificial ventilation and circulation.  4. Develop technical skills (e.g. insertion of endotracheal tubes, intravenous catheters).  5. Understand the rationale behind the choice of an anesthetic agent or technique.  6. Learn the function of an anesthesiologist as a perioperative physician and pain consultant.  7. Learn about the specialty of anesthesiology as a possible future career.    Notes:  Curriculum:    Direct participation in anesthetic evaluation and administration for surgical procedures is combined with close individual supervision. Attendance at weekly teaching conferences is expected. Each student will follow a patient pre, intra, and post operatively and write a case presentation.    Interblock: First consideration given to students interested in anesthesia as a career choice; honors considered only with documentation of participation and completion of a research project related to anesthesia.    Evaluations:  Evaluations are compiled from daily encounter cards completed by anesthesia providers, a written paper that discusses one patient's anesthetic, and a 50 question written examination at the end of the rotation.",

Ancient cave paintings depict men dressed in animal skins, holding objects resembling the rattles used by modern shamans among northern hunting peoples. The cave art also has entopic imagery that is seen in the shaman's mind during his shamanic rituals. In this course we will look at shamanism through time and in many cultures. We will also discuss the early accounts of shamanism by priests, explorers and adventurers, and how anthropology has come to understand and study this phenomenon.

Ancient cave paintings depict men dressed in animal skins, holding objects resembling the rattles used by modern shamans among northern hunting peoples. The cave art also has entopic imagery that is seen in the shaman's mind during his shamanic rituals. In this course we will look at shamanism through time and in many cultures. We will also discuss the early accounts of shamanism by priests, explorers and adventurers, and how anthropology has come to understand and study this phenomenon. Particular topics to be discussed include biological explanations for shamanic trances and visions, mental health concerning shamans, gender issues, and how shamans fit in with societal development and complexity.

Our inquiry begins with an exploration of the rococo as an ornamental style; we examine its origins in Italian garden architecture and subsequent transformation into a decoration for both French palatial interiors and German Churches.  We then launch a succession of case studies of important artists, media, and objects in order to assess the varied ways that diverse social identities were deflected through the periods' art an architecture.

We will provide an introduction to essential disciplines and interactions that enable scientific discoveries to move forward into novel device and drug therapies. Participants will come away with a very complete picture of how medical research happens, including: how it is funded; what is required to make discoveries and record and protect intellectual property that is created; how to advance innovations to clinical practice, how to navigate the regulatory and bioethical environment, and how discoveries reach practitioners and benefit patients.

Why did the pre-war Union prove unable to tolerate the plural visions and diverse institutions of its people? Was the descent into war more a measure of institutional weakness than of the intensity of moral conflict? What were the constituent elements of the competing wartime 'nationalisms' that evolved in both north and south? How and why did a war that began to restore the Union become one for emancipation? How  was it the forerunner of modern, 'total' warfare? Did the governmental, socio-economic and racial changes wrought by war constitute a 'second American revolution'? Were the limits or the achievements of post-war Reconstruction more notable? And, last but certainly not least, how did the triumph of the Union condition the political and economic development of a rapidly globalizing world?",
