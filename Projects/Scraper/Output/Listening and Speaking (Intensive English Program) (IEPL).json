Learn how to think and react quickly and correctly in times of stress.  3. Develop knowledge and skill at maintaining artificial ventilation and circulation.  4. Develop technical skills (e.g. insertion of endotracheal tubes, intravenous catheters).  5. Understand the rationale behind the choice of an anesthetic agent or technique.  6. Learn the function of an anesthesiologist as a perioperative physician and pain consultant.  7. Learn about the specialty of anesthesiology as a possible future career.    Notes:  Curriculum:    Direct participation in anesthetic evaluation and administration for surgical procedures is combined with close individual supervision. Attendance at weekly teaching conferences is expected. Each student will follow a patient pre, intra, and post operatively and write a case presentation.    Interblock: First consideration given to students interested in anesthesia as a career choice; honors considered only with documentation of participation and completion of a research project related to anesthesia.    Evaluations:  Evaluations are compiled from daily encounter cards completed by anesthesia providers, a written paper that discusses one patient's anesthetic, and a 50 question written examination at the end of the rotation.",

Ancient cave paintings depict men dressed in animal skins, holding objects resembling the rattles used by modern shamans among northern hunting peoples. The cave art also has entopic imagery that is seen in the shaman's mind during his shamanic rituals. In this course we will look at shamanism through time and in many cultures. We will also discuss the early accounts of shamanism by priests, explorers and adventurers, and how anthropology has come to understand and study this phenomenon.

We will also discuss the early accounts of shamanism by priests, explorers and adventurers, and how anthropology has come to understand and study this phenomenon. Particular topics to be discussed include biological explanations for shamanic trances and visions, mental health concerning shamans, gender issues, and how shamans fit in with societal development and complexity.

Our inquiry begins with an exploration of the rococo as an ornamental style; we examine its origins in Italian garden architecture and subsequent transformation into a decoration for both French palatial interiors and German Churches.  We then launch a succession of case studies of important artists, media, and objects in order to assess the varied ways that diverse social identities were deflected through the periods' art an architecture.

Why did the pre-war Union prove unable to tolerate the plural visions and diverse institutions of its people? Was the descent into war more a measure of institutional weakness than of the intensity of moral conflict? What were the constituent elements of the competing wartime 'nationalisms' that evolved in both north and south? How and why did a war that began to restore the Union become one for emancipation? How  was it the forerunner of modern, 'total' warfare? Did the governmental, socio-economic and racial changes wrought by war constitute a 'second American revolution'? Were the limits or the achievements of post-war Reconstruction more notable? And, last but certainly not least, how did the triumph of the Union condition the political and economic development of a rapidly globalizing world?",

Planning needs to begin early in the third year.   Offsite externship experiences are also available in certain community-based family practices and in certain family practice residency programs.  A list of pre-approved sites is available in the course office.  All of the sites available for the offsite experience have been carefully selected by the faculty based on previous experiences of fourth-year students.  These sites offer an appropriate level of patient care responsibility with supervision.  Offsite practices need to be approved in advance by the course director and often require planning 6 to 12 months in advance.  Students considering offsite rotations will be expected to have a clear idea of how these experiences will offer unique advantages to their personal and professional development, and how they will meet the course criteria. Many offsite locations used in the past for the Family Medicine Clerkship will not satisfy the externship requirement. They still offer excellent experiences and could be taken as electives.  Students on the offsite track will be evaluated with respect to their ability to collect, process, and analyze information, engage in clinical reasoning, and formulate appropriate diagnoses and treatment plans.

In this course, we will illustrate some of the principle ways in which Geographers investigate, explain, and map meaning, pushing the boundaries of what we know as individuals and society. Using a combination of discussion and field exercises, students will be asked to engage with a number of critical societal issues that have geographical elements at their core. Examples include the Geography of crime, imagining place, the city of the future, environmental change, terrorism, human trafficking, drones, and sustainability.",

Why did the pre-war Union prove unable to tolerate the plural visions and diverse institutions of its people? Was the descent into war more a measure of institutional weakness than of the intensity of moral conflict? What were the constituent elements of the competing wartime 'nationalisms' that evolved in both north and south? How and why did a war that began to restore the Union become one for emancipation? How was it the forerunner of modern, 'total' warfare? Did the governmental, socio-economic and racial changes wrought by war constitute a 'second American revolution'? Were the limits or the achievements of post-war Reconstruction more notable? And, last but certainly not least, how did the triumph of the Union condition the political and economic development of a rapidly globalizing world?",

Why did the pre-war Union prove unable to tolerate the plural visions and diverse institutions of its people? Was the descent into war more a measure of institutional weakness than of the intensity of moral conflict? What were the constituent elements of the competing wartime 'nationalisms' that evolved in both north and south? How and why did a war that began to restore the Union become one for emancipation? How  was it the forerunner of modern, 'total' warfare? Did the governmental, socio-economic and racial changes wrought by war constitute a 'second American revolution'? Were the limits or the achievements of post-war Reconstruction more notable? And, last but certainly not least, how did the triumph of the Union condition the political and economic development of a rapidly globalizing world?  Graded on A-F basis only.",

The popularity of documentary film in the past ten years has skyrocketed, and recent award-winning documentaries such as Inside Job (2010), Blackfish (2013), and The Invisible War (2012) are simultaneously entertaining audiences and investigating serious issues like the financial collapse, killer whale captivity, and sex crimes in the military--issues that in the past might have been covered exclusively by investigative journalism. What explains the public's growing fascination with documentary? How is documentary film reacting to recent transformations in the media landscape? Is it filling a critical need that journalism is no longer willing or able to meet? This course will explore the intersection of these two nonfiction storytelling forms - documentary film and journalism - and examine the role played by advocacy in both modes, as well as the cultural and ethical implications of the convergence between journalism and documentary film. In that it is centered on contemporary documentary film culture, the course also takes advantage of the True/ False Film Festival, and will be host to a conference during Week 6, featuring a number of major visiting filmmakers and film critics. Attendance at some sessions is required. Graded on A-F basis only.",

The focus of this course is on the craft of editing, as seen in a variety of documentary and other works and explained through the decisions made in and out of the editing room that lead to the final product. The course will introduce important concepts of editing, the work of significant editors in both documentary and narrative fiction films, and seek to apply those techniques to the conceptualization of documentary work students will do as part of their degree. Students will understand the history of documentary editing as it evolved on its own and as influenced by narrative fiction films, the language of editing, the work of important editors and directors and how it influences today's aesthetic and how to apply what they have learned to their own documentary projects at an advanced level.

The popularity of documentary film in the past ten years has skyrocketed, and recent award-winning documentaries such as Inside Job (2010), Blackfish (2013), and The Invisible War (2012) are simultaneously entertaining audiences and investigating serious issues like the financial collapse, killer whale captivity, and sex crimes in the military-issues that in the past might have been covered exclusively by investigative journalism. What explains the public's growing fascination with documentary? How is documentary film reacting to recent transformations in the media landscape? Is it filling a critical need that journalism is no longer willing or able to meet?  This course will explore the intersection of these two nonfiction storytelling forms--documentary film and journalism--and examine the role played by advocacy in both modes, as well as the cultural and ethical implications of the convergence between journalism and documentary film.  In that it is centered on contemporary documentary film culture, the course also takes advantage of the True/ False Film Festival, and will be host to a conference during Week 6, featuring a number of major visiting filmmakers and film critics.

The focus of this course is on the craft of editing, as seen in a variety of documentary and other works and explained through the decisions made in and out of the editing room that lead to the final product. The course will introduce important concepts of editing, the work of significant editors in both documentary and narrative fiction films, and seek to apply those techniques to the conceptualization of documentary work students will do as part of their degree. Students will understand the history of documentary editing as it evolved on its own and as influenced by narrative fiction films, the language of editing, the work of important editors and directors and how it influences today's aesthetic and how to apply what they have learned to their own documentary projects at an advanced level.
