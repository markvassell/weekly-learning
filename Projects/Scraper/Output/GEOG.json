In doing so, this course synthesizes material from numerous fields of study that fall under the burgeoning umbrella field of global change ecology. This synthetic approach is used to highlight the formidable linkages on Earth between the non-living and living, thus permitting students to gain an appreciation and holistic understanding of how global environmental change is impacting Earth processes responsible for creating both our current landscapes and the remarkable diversity of life that inhabit them.",

Geography gives us the means to formalize this impulse to explore the world around us, both local and distant. It allows us to make sense of the ways in which space and relationships between objects drives much of human, social, and environmental interaction. In this course, we will illustrate some of the principle ways in which Geographers investigate, explain, and map meaning, pushing the boundaries of what we know as individuals and society. Using a combination of discussion and field exercises, students will be asked to engage with a number of critical societal issues that have geographical elements at their core. Examples include the Geography of crime, imagining place, the city of the future, environmental change, terrorism, human trafficking, drones, and sustainability.",

This course explores issues surrounding immigration and migration.  Beginning with the demographic overview of immigration, it focuses on the challenges faced by immigrant, sending, and receiving nations in the global migration system.  The second part of the course focuses on the array of issues surrounding immigration to the United States, including the socio-economic adaptation of immigrants, the economic and cultural impacts of immigration, and illegal immigration.  The third part of the course focuses on internal migration within migration within the US, discussing topics such as migration to the Sunbelt, Great Plains depopulation, poverty migration, migration to the suburbs, and migration's impact on community.  Linkages between domestic migration and immigration will also be explored.",
