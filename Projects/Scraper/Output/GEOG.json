In doing so, this course synthesizes material from numerous fields of study that fall under the burgeoning umbrella field of global change ecology. This synthetic approach is used to highlight the formidable linkages on Earth between the non-living and living, thus permitting students to gain an appreciation and holistic understanding of how global environmental change is impacting Earth processes responsible for creating both our current landscapes and the remarkable diversity of life that inhabit them.",

Geography gives us the means to formalize this impulse to explore the world around us, both local and distant. It allows us to make sense of the ways in which space and relationships between objects drives much of human, social, and environmental interaction. In this course, we will illustrate some of the principle ways in which Geographers investigate, explain, and map meaning, pushing the boundaries of what we know as individuals and society. Using a combination of discussion and field exercises, students will be asked to engage with a number of critical societal issues that have geographical elements at their core. Examples include the Geography of crime, imagining place, the city of the future, environmental change, terrorism, human trafficking, drones, and sustainability.",

The course begins with study of Indigenous sovereignty and representation, and moves quickly to critical and theoretical readings in new media, tracing both the historical impact of digital technologies (such as GIS) on Native communities, and the ways that both urban and rural Native communities have engaged in innovative digital projects that expand the way we understand information and storytelling in digital environments.  The course materials will cover a wide range of platforms and audio-visual genres, from documentary, community video, and animation productions, to GIS, video games, and social media sites. Students will engage with both scholars and artists working with new media through a program of public lectures, classroom visits, and Skype interviews.  All interview will be archived as podcasts from the course website.  Students will write weekly short response papers and produce independent audio-visual projects over the course of the semester, with opportunities to revise their work leading up to substantial final projects.  The course will also integrate community outreach into the curriculum through online participation of students from the Kiowa Kids, an Indigenous language immersion and storytelling program.",

Beginning with the demographic overview of immigration, it focuses on the challenges faced by immigrant, sending, and receiving nations in the global migration system.  The second part of the course focuses on the array of issues surrounding immigration to the United States, including the socio-economic adaptation of immigrants, the economic and cultural impacts of immigration, and illegal immigration.  The third part of the course focuses on internal migration within migration within the US, discussing topics such as migration to the Sunbelt, Great Plains depopulation, poverty migration, migration to the suburbs, and migration's impact on community.  Linkages between domestic migration and immigration will also be explored.",
