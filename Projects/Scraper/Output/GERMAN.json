Students analyze the potential and limitations/effects of blogs and the web in specific contemporary cultural contexts and as part of the broader historical evolution of the web.  The course is taught in English.  The goal of this course is two-fold:  students learn the particulars of web blogging, explore various features of the contemporary social network landscape while focusing on the concept of culture, in particular the cultures of Europe and the US.  Questions asked are: what is culture?  What is common or popular right now in other cultures? And how do new social networks amplify or alter certain features or culture across national and international contexts?",
