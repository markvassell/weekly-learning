The popularity of documentary film in the past ten years has skyrocketed, and recent award-winning documentaries such as Inside Job (2010), Blackfish (2013), and The Invisible War (2012) are simultaneously entertaining audiences and investigating serious issues like the financial collapse, killer whale captivity, and sex crimes in the military--issues that in the past might have been covered exclusively by investigative journalism. What explains the public's growing fascination with documentary? How is documentary film reacting to recent transformations in the media landscape? Is it filling a critical need that journalism is no longer willing or able to meet? This course will explore the intersection of these two nonfiction storytelling forms - documentary film and journalism - and examine the role played by advocacy in both modes, as well as the cultural and ethical implications of the convergence between journalism and documentary film. In that it is centered on contemporary documentary film culture, the course also takes advantage of the True/ False Film Festival, and will be host to a conference during Week 6, featuring a number of major visiting filmmakers and film critics.

The course will introduce important concepts of editing, the work of significant editors in both documentary and narrative fiction films, and seek to apply those techniques to the conceptualization of documentary work students will do as part of their degree. Students will understand the history of documentary editing as it evolved on its own and as influenced by narrative fiction films, the language of editing, the work of important editors and directors and how it influences today's aesthetic and how to apply what they have learned to their own documentary projects at an advanced level.

The popularity of documentary film in the past ten years has skyrocketed, and recent award-winning documentaries such as Inside Job (2010), Blackfish (2013), and The Invisible War (2012) are simultaneously entertaining audiences and investigating serious issues like the financial collapse, killer whale captivity, and sex crimes in the military-issues that in the past might have been covered exclusively by investigative journalism. What explains the public's growing fascination with documentary? How is documentary film reacting to recent transformations in the media landscape? Is it filling a critical need that journalism is no longer willing or able to meet?  This course will explore the intersection of these two nonfiction storytelling forms--documentary film and journalism--and examine the role played by advocacy in both modes, as well as the cultural and ethical implications of the convergence between journalism and documentary film.  In that it is centered on contemporary documentary film culture, the course also takes advantage of the True/ False Film Festival, and will be host to a conference during Week 6, featuring a number of major visiting filmmakers and film critics.

The focus of this course is on the craft of editing, as seen in a variety of documentary and other works and explained through the decisions made in and out of the editing room that lead to the final product. The course will introduce important concepts of editing, the work of significant editors in both documentary and narrative fiction films, and seek to apply those techniques to the conceptualization of documentary work students will do as part of their degree. Students will understand the history of documentary editing as it evolved on its own and as influenced by narrative fiction films, the language of editing, the work of important editors and directors and how it influences today's aesthetic and how to apply what they have learned to their own documentary projects at an advanced level.

The ability to properly think of, clearly articulate, pitch and hone in on a project idea often makes the difference between a successful and unsuccessful final film.
